# Pharmaceutical mices analysis

This code analyzes two files with data on mice treated with drugs to cure cancer. In this study, 249 mice identified with SCC tumor growth were treated through a variety of drug regimens. Over the course of 45 days, tumor development was observed and measured. The purpose of this study was to compare the performance of Pymaceuticals' drug of interest, Capomulin, versus the other treatment regimes. Pandas and Matplotlib are used to visualize and read the data in form of multiple statistics and a variety of plots. Camopulin turns out to be the most effective drug out of the ones used. From the data, Camopulin is the best treatment at reducing tumor volume.
